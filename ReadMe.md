This web application will take user input for videogames (title, release year, developer name, and ESRB rating) 
which will then be stored in a database. A drop down menu has been populated with different genres 
that can be selected for the videogame. 

When the save button is clicked, user is sent to the gamesTable.php page where 
the database entries are organized and displayed in a table.
